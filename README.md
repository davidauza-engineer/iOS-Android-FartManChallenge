Welcome, please read the full document if you are planning to contribute to this game. If you happen to do so you will be added to the in-game credits and the credits in this repository too.

## Contributing to this Project

You can contribute by:

- Developing new gameplay modes.

- Providing graphical assets: Characters, enemies, scenarios, animations, items, etc.

- Providing sound assets: Sound effects, background music, soundtrack music, etc.

- Providing a script for a story mode.

You will need to clearly indicate the author of every piece contained in the pull request created to contribute, in order to accurately credit the parts involved, including you of course.

## Requirements for Contributing

1. A basic understanding of GameMaker Studio 2 workflow. You can check this short [series of videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEb4gzG8S24&list=PLhIbBGhnxj5IcGWhJQNF5hScmCCn4M3xg) to get a basic understanding and check this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/user/yoyogamesltd/playlists) to learn even more. All the documentation is found [here](https://docs2.yoyogames.com).

2. You need to own the work made by contributing. That means you personally need to write the code if you are developing a new feature, or having the rights over the pieces you want to contribute. You may also provide some assets obtained under licenses, but you will need to attach the corresponding license in the pull request.
